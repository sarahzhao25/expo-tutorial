Try adding as many as these features as you can manage:

Update to ES6 Classes instead of function components
Use FlatList to display messages
Make messages grow for larger text
Add Text Field on button to enter chat messages into the chat
Align your messages to the right and everyone else to the left
Group username headers so if the same person chats multiple times in a row it only shows once
Add date like username is listed (grouped as above)
Add multiple "Chat Channels" and a intro screen with a list of channels and the option to create a new one (new ones will have fake users added)
Store Channel state in a new redux state
Autogrow text input when adding new entries
Autoscroll to bottom when new message arrives
Prevent autoscroll if scrolled upwards viewing history (exception - when you send a new message)
Change your email address in the chat
Add speech bubble image behind each chat message
Open "User page" by tapping on user image (just email and gravatar image)
Add styling to show different colors for your message or theirs
Replace any 4-letter words with '****', and for censoring, would you do this on sending the message , on entering it in the store or when displaying it and why?


Bonus:
- Add Typescript
